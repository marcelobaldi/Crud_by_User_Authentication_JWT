/*
  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `users` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `users` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - Added the required column `age` to the `users` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Added the required column `image` to the `users` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - The required column `uid` was added to the `users` table with a prisma-level default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty. Please add this column as optional, then populate it before making it required.
